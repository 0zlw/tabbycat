"This is especially the case if any team that would be deleted has already "
"participated in a debate. If a team already has a result entered for it, "
"deleting the team also deletes those results, <strong>which normally breaks "
"the tab</strong>, even if you think you don't need those results anymore. If "
"a team has debated and is withdrawing from the tournament, you should "
"<strong>not</strong> delete it. Just mark the team inactive under the “Check-"
"Ins” section of the Tabbycat admin area."
