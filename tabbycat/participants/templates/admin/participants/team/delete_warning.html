      <strong>Warning:</strong> If there are “debate team” objects in the above
      list, <strong>you probably shouldn't delete the team(s)</strong>,
      especially if any team that you want to delete has already participated in
      a debate. If a team already has a result entered for it, deleting the team
      also deletes those results, <strong>which normally breaks the
      tab</strong>, even if you think you don't need those results anymore. If a
      team has debated and is withdrawing from the tournament, you should
      <strong>not</strong> delete it. Just mark the team inactive under the
      “Check-Ins” section of the Tabbycat admin area.

      If you're very sure about deleting this team, please delete the above
      objects first, and be sure to heed the warning that you will see on the
      “debate team” objects page before proceeding.
