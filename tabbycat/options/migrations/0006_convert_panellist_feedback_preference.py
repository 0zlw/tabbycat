# This is a data migration. It was written manually and its purpose is to
# convert the old "panellist_feedback_enabled" preference to the new
# "feedback_paths" preference. For it to work, you must *not* have run
# `python manage.py checkpreferences` (or `dj checkpreferences`) after commit
# 32e52f9 ("Remove deprecated panellist_feedback_enabled option #350"), which
# removes the old preference. Note that on a Heroku instance, this means that
# commits 32e52f9 through 385d428 ("Implement and close #351") must never have
# been deployed, since the post-compile script runs checkpreferences.
#
# If the old preference doesn't exist, this data migration silently fails.
