        This interface is intended to easily swap the positions of teams within
        a debate, such as for final rounds where these are not known in advance.
        However it can also be used to create new debates and edit existing
        matchups. This should be done with caution; edits to matchups will
        <em>remove any round results for the teams that are moved</em>. In
        general you should only ever edit draws this way before they are
        released; and only then if you don't want a 'correct' draw.

      {% blocktrans trimmed %}
        Note that changes to matchups will only be saved once a debate has
        <em>all of its team slots filled</em>. You can create new debates by
        dragging into the blank rows at the bottom, but debates cannot be
        deleted here â€” you will need to go into the Edit Database area for that.
