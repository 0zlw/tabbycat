    Tabbycat assigns sides in elimination rounds randomly. However, because in elimination rounds, many tournaments draw lots for sides in front of an audience, the sides are marked as "unconfirmed", so that it doesn't look like sides have been pre-assigned. After you confirm the draw, you'll need to confirm sides on the "Edit Sides/Matchups" page, even if you wish to accept Tabbycat's random assignment.

      Highlighted cells relate to changes in position balance, as follows:
      <ul>
        <li>Red cells indicates that the team could not be allocated a position that maintains
        position balance.</li>
        <li>Yellow cells indicate that the team was previously imbalanced, and is given the best position
         possible in this draw, but is nonetheless still imbalanced.</li>
        <li>Green cells indicate that the team's previous imbalance is resolved with this draw.</li>
