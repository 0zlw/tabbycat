Licence Information
===================

We haven't released Tabbycat under an open-source licence, so there is no formal and general right to use this software. Nonetheless, you're welcome to use Tabbycat when running a debating tournament as a not-for-profit activity. Tournaments where an individual or institution is making a profit require express permission, as does making modifications to Tabbycat for personal profit.

If using Tabbycat to run a tournament we would appreciate it if you would let us know that you're doing so and how it went. `Our Facebook group <https://www.facebook.com/groups/tabbycat.debate/>`_ is a great place to start, or you could email us â€” the contact details are on our `GitHub repository page`_.

We're also happy to help if you have any questions or feature requests, although we provide no warranty and disclaim all legal liability.
