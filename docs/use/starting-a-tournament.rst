Starting a tournament
=====================

This page outlines a few things you should do at the start of a tournament, after you've :ref:`imported the initial data <importing-initial-data>`. Once you've done these, proceed to :ref:`running a tournament <running-a-tournament>`.

Tournament configuration
========================

After importing all your data you can log into the site as an administrator by loading up the homepage and then using the **Login** button in the upper-right. From there you should go to the administration section of your tournament, and then go to the tournament configuration page by clicking **Tournament Config** at the upper right.

Here you can adjust the debate rules and interface options to your liking then hit **Save** when finished. We also offer a number of presets that apply particular rule sets (such as the Australs rules) or feature sets (such as displaying information normally released during briefs on the website).

Creating user accounts for the tab team
=======================================

Go to the data admin area (link in the upper-right) to add any users that should have access to data-entry functions, but not the main tab backend. See :ref:`user-accounts` for information on how to do this.

.. note:: The people you're adding accounts for should be physically present when you do this, so that they can enter their password.

Information for the briefing
============================

If you're using the online submissions feature, some things you should probably mention in the briefing:

- Adjudicators must fill out ballots completely, including motions and venuesâ€”they are entered into the system.
- There is a static URL for each person's ballots and feedback forms. It can be bookmarked, or the page can refreshed after each round.
- If people submit a result or feedback online, they should indicate that they have done so on the paper copy of their ballot.
