Finishing a Tournament
======================

This page outlines some final steps to take after the conclusion of outrounds.

Tab Release
===========

Tabs can be released using the *Tab released* option under **Setup** > **Configuration**. Tabbycat offers a Team Tab, Speakers Tab, Pros Tab, Novices Tab, Replies Tab, and Motions Tab that can be each released independently. Additionally, you can limit each of these tabs to only show a set number of speakers, i.e. only release a "Top 10 Speakers" tab.

There is also the option to redact individual speaker's identifying details (name, team, and institution) from the public individual tabs. You can do so by going into the **Edit Database** area, going to *Participants > Speakers*, finding the speaker and clicking the **Anonymous** box (and saving).

.. note:: Public tab pages are cached for performance reasons. This means that any changes that affect a tab page (say redacting a speaker or changing a speaker score) may not show up on the public site for up to an hour.

Wrapping Up
===========

You probably want to turn off the *Public ballots*, *Public feedback*, *Feedback progress*, and *Public draw* features under **Configuration** at this stage as they no longer have any use.

You also want to go into the **Edit Database** area, find the tournament and hit "release all" so that the results for the final round can be released.
