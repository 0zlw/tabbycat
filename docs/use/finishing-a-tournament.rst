Finishing a tournament
======================

This page outlines some final steps after the preliminary rounds.

Wrapping up
===========

Tabs can be released using the *Tab released* option under configuration.

Note that you probably want to turn off the *Public ballots*, *Public feedback*, *Feedback progress*, and *Public draw* features at this stage as they no longer have any use.

You also want to go into the data admin area, find the tournament` and hit "release all" so that the results for the final round can be released.
