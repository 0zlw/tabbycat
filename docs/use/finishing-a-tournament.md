# Finishing a Tournament

This page outlines some final steps after the preliminary rounds.

## Wrapping Up

Tabs can be released using the *Tab released* option under configuration.

Note that you probably want to turn off the *Public ballots*, *Public feedback*, *Feedback progress*, and *Public draw* features at this stage as they no longer have any use.

You also want to go into the Data Admin area, find the `Tournament` and hit "release all" so that the results for the very-final round can be released.
