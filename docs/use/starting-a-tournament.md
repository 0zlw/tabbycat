# Starting a Tournament

This page outlines a few things you should do at the start of a tournament, after you've [imported the initial data](importing-data.md). Once you've done these, proceed to *[running a tournament](running-a-tournament.md)*.

## Tournament Configuration

After importing all your data you can log into the site as an administrator by loading up the homepage and then using the *Login* button in the upper-right. From there you should go to the administration section of your tournament, and then go to the tournament configuration page by clicking **Tournament Config** at the upper right.

Here you can adjust the debate rules and interface options to your liking then hit **Save** when finished. We also offer a number of presets that apply particular rule sets (such as the Australs rules) or feature sets (such as displaying information normally released during briefs on the website).

## Creating User Accounts for the Tab Team

Go to the Data Admin area (link in the upper-right) to add any users that should have access to data-entry functions, but not the main tab backend. See [User accounts and interfaces#adding accounts](../features/user-accounts-and-interfaces.md) for information on how to do this.

> *The people you're adding accounts for should be physically present when you do this, so that they can enter their password.*

## Information for the Briefing

If you're using the online submissions feature, some things you should probably mention in the briefing:

- Adjudicators must fill out ballots completely, including motions and venues - they are entered into the system.
- There is a static URL for each person's ballots and feedback forms. It can be bookmarked, or the page can refreshed after each round.
- If people submit a result or feedback online, they should indicate that they have done so on the paper copy of their ballot.
