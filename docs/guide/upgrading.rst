Upgrading Tabbycat
==================

Generally only want to upgrade copies of tab sites that are used on an ongoing basis, or if there is a bugfix release.

If you have a github account, you could fork the tabbycat repo and then connect your app to this and deploy from it using the Deploy tab in the heroku dashboard

If you know (or want to learn) git you would clone tabbycat and then push it up to heroku as described here (https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/git#deploying-code
