Tournament Logistics
====================

Unlike the rest of our documentation this section does not concern particular features or technical concerns with Tabbycat itself. Instead it is an attempt to outline the logistics of tab direction and aims to be of general relevance for people running medium and large tournaments. At present it is organised by the various ‘stages’ of tabbing a tournament, and most of the content takes the form of checklists or comments designed to highlight and provide guidance on common issues. To reduce clutter in the rest of the documentation it is formatted as a single page; using the sub-sections in the sidebar is reccomended for navigating across sections.

While it aims for general relevance, we should note that it is relatively opinionated and mostly written from the perspective of people whose primary experience is tabbing at Australasian tournaments using Tabbycat. That said we welcome feedback and additions that can account for different format and regional considerations. In the future, if the guide becomes more general and more extensive, it could be spun off into a seperate project.

.. note:: As with the rest of our documentation, this page is open source [link to source] and we welcome feedback and contributions.

Planning and Preparation
========================

This section aims to outline concerns that occur in the months before the tournament: after you have agreed to help with tabbing and while the org-com and adj-core are deciding how they want to run key processes such as registration and feedback. It is organised in terms of who you should coordinate with to in order to plan for a well-tabbed tournament along with some general concerns.

General
-------

- You should try avoid being the sole person responsible for that tab unless it is a small tournament. There are many cases where you want to be in several places at once and the easiest way to accommodate that is by having co-directors or trusted assistants. Few tab decisions require a single source of authority; it is far better to have multiple people available to share responsibilities around.
- In a similar manner, it is worth considering how you can use the tournament to help train other people. Typically knowledge of tabbing is concentrated in relatively few people and gained mostly through on-the-ground experience; meaning that every tournament can be approached as an opportunity to train new people. Consider reaching out to institutions or the tournament as a whole to see if they have anyone who would be interested in helping.

Convenors
---------

It might sound obvious but it will pay to have a very thorough conversation about the tab process (more or less the contents of this document) with the convenors a few months out from the tournament. Do this even if you know the convenors to be knowledgeable or experienced debaters. Key concerns are:

- Whether internet access will be available and whether participants can be presumed to have smart phones. This has an obvious impact on how online feedback, ballots, and draw release is done. Note that Eduroam is not necessarily a reliable guarantee of access; many universities can’t access it or set up is often something that is difficult or requires students do so while at their home institution.
- What kind of room is the tab room going to be? Is it possible to optimize its placement when the bookings for rooms are made? Key details include: How large is it?  Does it have a sufficient amount of desk space (for data entry)? Does it have a good projector (for allocations)?
- What kind of printers will be available? Can the tournament buy/borrow one? This is obviously a key consideration for pre-printed ballots. Also try and ensure there are back-up printing options if possible; clearly stipulate your need for ink and paper; and try and opt for a black/white laserjet, over an inkjet, if possible.
- What kind of runners/volunteers will be available? How many, and what is their experience level?
- Will the tournament make a donation to Tabbycat or whoever maintains the tabbing software you are using? Note that this is required if the tournament is generating a profit for the host institution or it’s organisers. Accounting officers should also be aware that there will be some costs associated with hosting the tab. You should also ensure that people helping with the tab are fairly compensated for their flights, registration, etc and that any volunteers are invited along to socials and/or given some other recompense.
- Will Swing teams be available? You should plan to have one more than you need. For example, with 79 teams, you should have both an 80th swing team to fill in the draw, and the option to easily assemble an 81st swing team in case a team goes AWOL.
- Ensure that food will be brought to tab room. Otherwise you will starve and the adjudication core will swan off to lunch.
- How will critical information be communicated to participants? Consider that in general, Facebook announcements do not reach many people, although paying to boost the posts is often a very cheap way of dramatically raising their effectiveness. In particular also ensure or check how you manage to get in touch with teams or adjudicators who go AWOL: will they have reliable phone numbers? Can you get a list of institutional reps who can be reliably called? You want to have processes in place for chasing up adjudicators who do things such as make scoring mistakes as soon as possible in order to minimise delays.
- At large tournaments you want to arrive at least a day before check-in; and ideally whenever it is that the adjudication core is arriving for their preparation.

Registration
------------

Having effective registration systems and processes is one of the most important aspects of preparing to tab a large tournament. Bad registration data *will* make setting up a tab extremely painful and introduces the chance for mistakes or inconsistencies in tab data that will only come to light in the first round. As such:

- You should check in with the registration team and see what they plan to do as soon as possible after being brought onboard. As part of this you should make it clear that you should be consulted on any decisions they make about what data to collect, when to collect it, and how to collect it.
- Registration data should be collected into a shared and live-updating source, such as a Google Sheet. There should be as few canonical sources (ideally one) of data as possible; i.e. there should be a single sheet for individual details, a single sheet for team details, etc; and these should be maintained all the way through to check-in. For both you, and the registration team, having multiple conflicting or outdated copies of data will lead to errors. However for the registration team these errors can usually be easily sorted out in person (at check-in) but for you that information always needs to have a data-trail otherwise what is imported into the tab will quickly become incorrect.

    - At this point our recommendation is to, in most cases, use specialised registration systems as they are somewhat inflexible and less intuitive than Google forms/sheets.

- You should have access to all of the data collected; often registration teams will make (false) assumptions about what you do or do not need. It is better to have everything and then selectively filter out (when needed) what you do not want.
- It is critical that the registration team should check in with you before setting up forms asking for information. Every additional time that registration asks for data there will be less and less participation in the process, so you should aim to gather all that you need at the first opportunity; typically during the canonical individual registration phase. Particular information that should not be overlooked for tab purposes:

    - Individual registration should ask for a person's team name/number (reconciling these later is painful).
    - Individual registration should ask for any accessibility requirements people may have.
    - Individual registration should ask for the previous institutions of adjudicators.
    - Individual registration should ask for the email addresses of all participants.
    - Individual registration should ask for the phone numbers of adjudicators.

- Independent adjudicators and the adjudication core should follow normal registration procedures. Having them not go through the normal process makes it easy to overlook their data or not get a complete picture of it. For example adjudication core members might forget to nominate conflicts, or neglect to provide their previous institutions.
- You should confirm how the registration team plans to manage check-in in particular. Check-in is when issues with registration data come to light and it is vital that these changes are noted and recorded. Some form of validation of registration data *must* occur at check-in — in particular all adjudicators should be (individually) verified as present and all members of a team should confirm their presence along with team name/number and their speakers.
- After checkin you need to have a definitive list of who is physically present at the tournament so you can run a first-round draw with confidence. Registration must know this and have processes in place for recording people individually as they arrive, and for that data to filter back to you.
- If you are using Tabbycat’s secret links for feedback or ballots these are best distributed at check-in. Rego should know about this, prepare for it, and be provided with the pdfs to print and distribute.

Adjudication Core
-----------------

CA/DCA’s will often leave tab-relevant decisions until the days prior to the first round or whenever it is that they can meet with the tab team in person. However this often wastes critical time and forces rushed decisions. Many considerations can instead be raised and discussed prior to the tournament.

- If there is a group chat for the adjudication core you probably want to be part of it; even if you don't contribute much. There are lots of small things that end up being discussed without consideration of how they will affect tab issues. It is also a chance to get to know — ahead of time — the people you will be working with closely over the tournament.
- How to managing the adjudicator feedback process is also something that benefits from foresight and pre-planning, rather than being decided on the ground. Key considerations are:

    - What is the score scale going to be? What do each of those numbers represent? How will this be communicated to participants?
    - How much weight does a test score have over the course of the tournament? By Round 3, or by Round 8, what proportion of an adjudicator’s score is derived from their test? Etc.
    - Who submits feedback on whom? Do trainees do so on chairs? Etc.
    - Is feedback mandatory? If so, how will this be enforced exactly?
    - What kind of questions will feedback forms ask? Tabbycat is highly configurable here; both in terms of the types of questions offered, and the option to only show them to certain types of participant (ie chairs, teams). Consider how these questions be used tactically to identify key issues (say discriminatory scoring) or identify people who should be promoted/demoted.
    - How will feedback be monitored, and how will this information feed back into the scores and allocations? At large tournaments it is not unusual for an adjudication core member to sit off each round to review and process feedback — there isn’t really a good stretch of time to do it otherwise. However there are communication issues to manage here (adj-core members each only have incomplete information of feedback). It’s also worth considering whether adj-cores will manually raise/lower test marks in order to adjust adjudicator’s ratings to where they think they should be.

- It helps to have the adjudication core establish policies for somewhat common but niche problems. This way you know what to do when these cases arise and you can exclude/include a ballot quickly and get on with the next round. The most common issue here is what to do when an adjudicator can’t give an adjudication because they are missing or incapacitated during the debate (ie drunk or visibly sleeping).
- If possible it's nice to know in advance when the tab will be released (ie on the last night; the day after; etc) as this often gets left to the last minute to be dedicated. Also the possibility of whether people can redact themselves from tabs should be raised, as that might be useful to inform participants of during rego/briefings. Some adjudication cores might also want to limit speaker tabs to only a certain number of places.
- How to handle conflict collection; particularly if teams can specify conflicts (see below section).

Conflicts (Registration/Equity/Adjudication Core)
---------

- There should always be a *single* means of collecting conflicts (i.e. a Google Sheet/Form) all conflicts should go through it. Get in touch in with equity and registration in advance and make it clear that they should not make their own conflicts form (or if they’ve already made one, make sure you adopt it and have access/control of it). Conflicts data should never be spread across a loose collection of email/personal messages/spreadsheets; otherwise keeping track and knowing which ones have been entered into the system will be painful and error prone. Because the nature of this data is sensitive and evolving, there must be a single location where it can be recorded and verified as having been entered into the tab.
- Conflicts should, ideally, *only be gathered after a participants list has been published* and requests for conflicts data should be sent out as few times as possible. Most people will only fill this form in once, so it is vital that when asked to nominate conflicts that they have as much information as they need to do so comprehensively. Without a full participants list people will either nominate conflicts that are not present (wasting your time in cross-referencing data) or not realise someone is present and raise the conflict at a latter, less opportune time.
- In some circuits only adjudicators are allowed to nominate conflicts because of the risk of teams using conflicts 'tactically' to block adjudicators that they think are bad. However, having teams nominate conflicts can be useful: adjudicators may overlook a conflict or there may be equity-based reasons that a conflict is non-symmetrical or confidential. This can be handled in two ways:

    - Not allow teams to nominate conflicts during registration; but allow them to approach equity teams before, or during, the tournament to identify the conflict. Equity can then raise the issue with the tab team and adjudication core and it can be added to the tab.
    - Allow teams to nominate conflicts during registration; but have the adjudication core review the data for 'tactical' conflicts. These are usually relatively easily identified, although can be overlooked if the adjudication core does not know the  participants and/or if a non-blatant quantity are added. The adjudication core can then override the conflict, discuss it with the teams, or raise it with equity. However, if going down this route, the tab team should discuss with the adjudication core how to manage this process well-ahead of the tournament, and ensure they actually do review the conflicts prior to the first round — otherwise it will become a derailing distraction during critical time periods such as allocations.

- As mentioned in the previous section, the adjudication team (possibly with equity) should provide some degree of guidance about what kinds of debating-related conflicts should be provided. Obviously people should be able to self-define what constitutes a conflict, but there are circumstances where they are overly cautious and can be reassured that it is not necessary. The opposite problem may occur also, where many people may have a very high bar for what defines a conflict which could lead to perceptions of bias from other participants.
- In poorly-structured conflict forms, identifying exactly who is doing the conflicting and who is being conflicted is a nightmare. You want to structure the questions to minimise this ambiguity. A form should definitely ask:

    - Are you (the conflict-specifier) a team or an adjudicator?
    - Which institution are you from?
    - If part of a team, which team are you in?
    - Who are you conflicting?
    - Which institution are they from?
    - If they are in a team, which team is it?
    - For adjudicators: have previously attended any other institutions; or have other reasons to conflict entire institutions? If so, specify those institutions.

- Generally, it is preferable that each form nominates a single conflict, and people are asked to re-submit for each conflict they are adding.
- Adj-core members will often not nominate their own conflicts; presuming that they will notice and correct them during allocations. They often forget or overlook this. Their conflicts should be entered as per normal.

Scheduling (Convenors / Venue Organisers)
-------

One of the easiest ways to have things run late is to set an unrealistic schedule. As much as possible the round/lunch/etc timing should conform to an even distribution of how long it takes to process results and create a draw/allocation; you don’t want to be in a position where particular rounds have much too much or too little time to spend on allocations and other crucial tasks. This is something that should definitely be working on in conjunction with convenors and other critical parties before they lock down timing details with food suppliers or the venue hosts.

Note also that in most circumstances it is almost always preferable to create a draw and allocation for the first day of the next round at the night before. This time should be built in to the schedule of the previous day, and raised with the adjudication core so they don’t expect to be able to immediately depart after the last day’s rounds complete.

Below is the time taken within each round at Australs 2017. For context, this was neither a particular efficiently or inefficiently tabbed tournament. Notable details:

- The tournament was ~40 rooms each round and had access to 3-6 runners and data enterers. Paper ballots were pre-printed and distributed by runners to rooms prior to the debates starting, then collected some time after the 15 minutes deliberation period. Feedback was submitted online.
- The adjudication core were neither particular slow or fast in allocating adjudicators compared to other adjudication cores in an Australs context where allocations are first automatically generated then extensively tweaked.
- There were no serious issues that delayed the tabbing of any particular round beyond the expected issues of last-minute draw changes, adjudicators producing incomprehensible ballots, etc.
- While the tab ran relatively quickly there were delays (or periods where allocations could take longer than typical) because of mismatches between the planned schedule and the optimal schedule from a tab perspective.
- A round at Australs takes around 2 hours from a debater’s perspective: 30 minutes of prep, ~60 minutes for a debate, ~15 minutes for deliberation, and ~15 minutes for the oral adjudication and feedback.

Tab Site Setup
==============

Setting up a tab site is the most technically challenging (or at least annoying) part of tabbing. It is where you need to reconcile large amounts of data and configure a variety of settings to ensure everything will run without issues during rounds. While this is often done a day or two before the tournament, ideally you should look to do as much as possible in the week or two beforehand.

Setup the Site
--------------

- Presuming you are using Tabbycat, and deploying to Heroku, read our documentation about the size of Postgres database your tournament will require. Setting up the correct size from the start is the best way to go, as transferring information at a later stage is a hassle.
- If the tournament (or the host society) has their own domain name consider whether you want to set up the tab site on the domain so that the URL is nicer.

Importing Data: Workflow
------------------------

- First check with registration people if their data is complete, and if not who is missing. If it’s only a few people it’s viable (for tab purposes) to use place-holders for them, as long as you remember to follow up and edit their data manually later.
- Familiarise yourself with the different methods for importing data into Tabbycat. If using the spreadsheet importer, know how to operate it, and how to transfer data from a local to Heroku-hosted copy. That said, importing using the visual importer is viable for larger tournaments if you are not comfortable with the command line.

    - Typically the process using the spreadsheet importer is to set-up the CSV files then try to import them into a local copy of Tabbycat database and verify it works.
    - It will likely take several tries for it to work due to minor mismatches in speaker/institution names etc. The importer usually will spit out errors when something is malformed/mis-formatted. Usually the process is to then reimport until everything passes without errors.
    - Once the import has passed you can then push database to live. Generally from then on any changes will be done to the live tab unless there are huge amounts of problems requiring a re-import.

Importing Data: Regions/Societies
---------------------------------

- Societies will often have special names that they like to use in draws (that are not the same as their institution’s name or acronym. These can be gathered from institutional reps or from prior tabs. When in doubt err on the colloquial / most recognisable name; particularly for formats where teams need to find each other prior to the debate.
- Determine the types of regions that will be assigned to institutions with adjudication core. This has impacts for the kinds of representation/diversity the tab can show during allocations.

Importing Data: Participants
----------------------------

- Check you have emails/phone numbers included in the imported sheets; there are useful to have on hand later for either emailing out feedback links or following up errant adjudicators.
- Often the easiest way to prepare the sheets to import is to create new tabs in the registration data sheet, and use referencing to automatically order and arrange their data into the format Tabbycat wants.
- Often some adjudicators, typically local independents, may not be available for all rounds. Try and find out who this affects and when; once data has been imported you can pre-check these adjudicators in and out of rounds.
- Remember that the swing team(s) also need to be imported.

Data Import: Venues
-------------------

- Ideally you want not just a list of rooms, but also of categories — i.e. what buildings or colour code a room belongs to.
- You also want some idea of priority; that is to say if some rooms are inconvenient (and you have more rooms than you need) they should be marked as a low priority so they will not be allocated.
- You should want to know if access to some rooms is conditional. After the data is imported you can use the check-in system to record this information into the tab.
- Registration should have collected information about accessibility requirements; they should be imported (or added post-import) as Venue Constraints.
- Generally you want to assign adjudication core members rooms that are close to the tab room. These can be either imported (or added post-import) as Venue Constraints.

Data Import: Adj Test Scores
----------------------------

- Ideally the adjudication core should do this themselves as they are marking the test.

Data Import: User Accounts
--------------------------

- Set up user accounts for the adjudication core
- Set up user accounts for runners/assistants with dummy passwords (they can change them later)

Emailing out links
------------------

- For international tournaments the use online ballots or online feedback, participants should be emailed out their private URLs before people start travelling to arrive at a tournament (i.e. when they have a reasonable chance of checking their email). This can be done using the inbuilt pages on Tabbycat, or by importing participants data into a service such as Mailchimp.
