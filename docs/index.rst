ðŸ˜¸ Tabbycat User Guide
======================

Tabbycat is a draw tabulation system for two-team parliamentary debate
tournaments.

.. attention:: This documentation is currently for our development version, which
    (unless you know otherwise) is probably not the version you're using. The
    next version of Tabbycat, probably 0.8, will be the first to use this exciting
    upgraded documentation system. The documentation for our current official
    release (0.7.3) is on the `GitHub Wiki
    <https://github.com/czlee/tabbycat/wiki>`_.
