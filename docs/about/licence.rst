Licence information
===================

Formally, we haven't released Tabbycat under an open-source licence, so there is no formal general right to use this software. Nonetheless, if you're running a debating tournament, you're welcome to use Tabbycat. We would appreciate it if you would please let us know that you're doing so, and let us know how it went. `Our Facebook group <https://www.facebook.com/groups/tabbycat.debate/>`_ is a great place to start.

You can also e-mail us; our e-mail addresses are on our `GitHub repository page`_.

We're happy to help if you have any questions or feature requests, although we provide no warranty and disclaim all legal liability.
