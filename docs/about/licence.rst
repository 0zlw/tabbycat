Licence information
===================

Formally, we haven't released Tabbycat under an open-source licence, so there is no formal general right to use this software. Nonetheless, if you're running a debating tournament, you're welcome to use it. We would appreciate it if you would please let us know that you're doing so, and let us know how it went. `Our Facebook group <https://www.facebook.com/groups/tabbycat.debate/>`_ is a great place to start. We're happy to help if you have any questions or feature requests although we provide no warranty and disclaim all legal liability.

Pull requests are encouraged and if you're interested in helping out as a developer, we'd love to have you! `Join our Facebook group <https://www.facebook.com/groups/tabbycat.debate/>`_ and contact us as below.

If you have a GitHub account, we'd prefer that **bug reports** be submitted to our `issues page <https://github.com/czlee/tabbycat/issues>`_. Otherwise, feel free to [shoot us an email](#authors-and-contacts).
