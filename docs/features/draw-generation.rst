Draw Generation
===============

The draw generator is quite flexible. You can specify a number of settings to suit different tournaments' rules.


Options
=======
The options discussed here are set in the **Configuration** page as described in :ref:`starting a tournament <starting-a-tournament>`.

.. caution:: The valid options for intermediate bubbles change depending on whether sides are pre-allocated, but these are **not** checked for validity. If you choose an invalid combination, Tabbycat will just crash. This won't corrupt the database, but it might be momentarily annoying.

Odd bracket resolution
----------------------
The **draw odd brackets** option specifies what you do when a bracket has an odd number of teams. (Obviously you have to do something, otherwise you can't pair off teams within the bracket.) There are two groups of methods: pull-up and intermediate bubbles.

* **Pull-up methods** take one or more teams from the next bracket down, and move them into the odd bracket to fill the bracket.
* **Intermediate bubbles** take the excess teams from the odd bracket and move them down into a new bubble, which sits between the odd bracket and the next one down (hence the name "intermediate"). It then takes one or more teams from the next bracket down and moves them to fill the new intermediate bubble.

The exact mechanics depend on whether or not sides are pre-allocated.

When sides are not pre-allocated
********************************

**Pull-up methods** take a team from the next bracket down, and add them to the odd bracket to form an even bracket. You might pull up the top team from the next bracket, or the bottom team, or a randomly chosen team.

**Intermediate bubbles** take the bottom team from the odd bracket and match them against the top team from the next bracket. An intermediate bubble always has two teams.

If you're using conflict avoidance and intermediate bubbles, you will probably want to use `Intermediate with bubble-up-bubble-down` instead. This uses the "bubble-up-bubble-down" rule to swap teams out of an intermediate bubble if there is a history or institution conflict. This is defined in the Australs constitution and is analogous to the "one-up-one-down" rule.

.. caution:: Using `Intermediate` with `One-up-one-down` does **not** imply `Intermediate with bubble-up-bubble-down`. You must enable `Intermediate with bubble-up-bubble-down` specifically.

When sides are pre-allocated
****************************

When sides are pre-allocated, an "odd bracket" is one that has an uneven number of affirmative and negative teams. (So odd brackets can have an even number of teams, *e.g.* 4 affs and 2 negs.)

**Pull-up methods** take as many teams from the next bracket down as necessary to fill the bracket. If there aren't enough teams in the next bracket down, it will take teams from the bracket after that, and so on, until the (original) odd bracket is filled. Higher brackets are always filled first. You might pull up the top teams from the next bracket, the bottom teams, or a random selection of teams.

**Intermediate bubbles** take the unpaired teams in a bracket, and move them down to a new intermediate bubble. It then takes the number of teams necessary from the opposite side, from the next bracket down, to fill the next bubble.

`Intermediate 1` and `Intermediate 2` differ only in what happens if there aren't enough teams in the next bracket to fill the intermediate bubble. In `Intermediate 1`, it will just take teams from the bracket after that, and so on, until the intermediate bubble is filled. In `Intermediate 2`, it will split the intermediate bubble: the teams that can be paired with the next bracket form the first intermediate bubble, and then the teams that aren't form a new (unfilled) intermediate bubble, to be filled from teams from the bubble after that. This keeps going, splitting into as many intermediate bubbles as necessary, until all excess teams from the original odd bracket are paired.

Side allocations
----------------
There are four methods:

* `Random` allocates randomly. Some tournaments might like this, but most will probably want to use `balance`, because `Random` doesn't guarantee that a team won't be (say) affirming the entire tournament.
* `Balance` assigns the team that has affirmed less so far the affirmative side (and, therefore, the team that has negated less the negative side). If both teams have affirmed the same number of times, it assigns sides randomly.
* `Preallocated` is used for pre-allocated sides. If used, you must enter data for pre-allocated sides into the database, as specified below.
* `Manually enter from ballot` is used for tournaments where the sides of the teams involved are not assigned in advance, but are instead determined by the teams themselves

Pre-allocated sides
*******************
There isn't currently any way to edit side allocations from the front end. To do so from the back end, you need to create one ``TeamPositionAllocation`` entry for each team in each round. All teams must have an allocation for every round. There are a few ways to do this, take your pick:

* If you're using the :ref:`importtournament command <importtournament-command>`, it reads sides from the file sides.csv.
* You can do this from the Django admin interface (under Setup > Edit Database) by going to the relevant team and adding a **team position allocation** entry. That is:

  #. Click **Admin** on the bottom right of any page after logging into an account with :ref:`superuser access <user-accounts>`.
  #. Next to **Teams**, click **Change**.
  #. Click on the name of the team you want to edit side allocations for.
  #. Add or edit the entry or entries in the **Team position allocations** table at the bottom.

* You can also do this by writing a script that creates ``TeamPositionAllocation`` objects and saves them. Have a look at data/utils/add_random_side_allocations.py for an example.

Pairing method
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
It's easiest to describe these by example, using a ten-team bracket:

* `Fold`: 1 vs 10, 2 vs 9, 3 vs 8, 4 vs 7, 5 vs 6. (Also known as high-low pairing.)
* `Slide`: 1 vs 6, 2 vs 7, 3 vs 8, 4 vs 9, 5 vs 10.
* `Random`: paired at random within bracket.
* `Adjacent`: 1 vs 2, 3 vs 4, 5 vs 6, 7 vs 8, 9 vs 10. (Also known as high-high pairing.)

Teams are always paired within their brackets, after resolving odd brackets.

Conflict avoidance method
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
A **conflict** is when two teams would face each other that have seen each other before, or are from the same institutions. Some tournaments have a preference against allowing this if it's avoidable within certain limits. The **draw avoid conflicts** option allows you to specify how.

You can turn this off by using `Off`. Other than this, there is currently one conflict avoidance method implemented.

The `One-up-one-down method` is the method specified in the Australs constitution. Broadly speaking, if there is a debate with a conflict:

* It tries to swap teams with the debate "one up" from it in the draw.
* If that doesn't work, it tries to swap teams with the debate "one down" from it in the draw.
* If neither of those works, it accepts the original conflicted debate.

It's a bit more complicated than that, for two reasons:

* History conflicts are prioritised over (*i.e.*, "worse than") institution conflicts. So it's fine to resolve a history conflict by creating an institution conflict, but not the vice versa.
* Each swap obviously affects the debates around it, so it's not legal to have two adjacent swaps. (Otherwise, in theory, a team could "one down" all the way to the bottom of the draw!) So there is an optimization algorithm that finds the best combination of swaps, *i.e.* the one that minimises conflict, and if there are two profiles that have the same least conflict, then it chooses the one with fewer swaps.

What do I do if the draw looks wrong?
================================================================================

You can edit match-ups directly from the draw page. Technically, you can do anything you want. Of course, operationally, you should only edit the draw when you *know* that the draw algorithm got something wrong. If you need to do this, even just once, please file a bug report by creating a new issue on `our issues page on GitHub <https://github.com/czlee/tabbycat/issues>`_.

Technical notes
================================================================================

.. note:: The information in this section should be read in conjunction with the source code documentation.

The draw module is based around ``DrawGenerator``, a factory function that returns a subclass of ``BaseDrawGenerator``. ``DrawGenerator`` takes two mandatory arguments: ``draw_type``, a string, and ``teams``, a list of ``Team``-like objects.

As a design principle, the draw module does not rely on internal knowledge of ``models.py``. Rather, to enforce abstraction and to ease unit testing, it is written as a stand-alone module that could, in principle, be used by other applications. Therefore, it defines an interface and uses duck-typing to work with inputs.

``Team``-like objects are the main part of this interface. The draw module doesn't provide a base object for ``Team``-like objects, nor does it expect them to be a Django model or be called ``Team``. Rather, it merely expects ``Team``-like objects to have certain attributes, depending on the options passed to ``DrawGenerator``. For example, for power-paired draws, ``Team``-like objects must have the ``points`` attribute. (For further details, refer to the source code.) Because ``DrawGenerator`` returns the same objects in some methods, ``Team``-like objects must be hashable.

The ``make_draw()`` method returns a list of ``Pairing`` objects. The ``Pairing`` class is defined in the draw module. Its ``teams`` attribute (and all attributes derived from it) contain the same ``Team``-like objects that were passed to ``DrawGenerator``.
