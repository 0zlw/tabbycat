Check-Ins
=========

A 'Check-in' is a record of a speaker or adjudicator's presence at a particular point in time. Typically these are used at large tournaments to reliably track who is or is not present for the first round of each day.

Check-ins serve a similar purpose to the :ref:`availability <availability>` system. However availabilities are tied to a particular round rather than a particular time, and so can be used to record instances where you know ahead of time whether a person should be included in the draw, or to exclude someone from a draw even though they are present. That said, the availability allows you to easily mark adjudicators or teams who have checked-in as available for a given round.

Check-In Identifiers
====================

Check-ins are associated with a 'identifier' â€” a number that is unique to each speaker and adjudicator. To generate these numbers go to the *Identifiers* section under the Check-Ins menu. From here you generate identifiers for Speakers, Adjudicators, and Venues as needed. Note also that Identifiers can be manually added or edited in the *Edit Database* area if necessary.

Once this number has been generated it can be transformed into a barcode so that it can be easily included on tournament badges or otherwise printed and disbursed. On the same *Identifiers* page you can use the *View barcodes* option to open up a page that lists all the barcodes for the speakers, adjudicators, or venues.

Recording Check-Ins
===================

On the *Scanning* section of Check-ins you can record a particular check-in. This can be done in a few different ways:

1. You can type in the Identifier number into the box. Once five numbers have been identified it will automatically issue the check-in and clear the input field for the next number.

2. If you have purchased barcode scanners and configured them as USB keyboards they should then be compatible with this page. I.E. upon page load the cursor should be positioned in the input field, and any scanned barcodes should populate it with the specified number, issue the check-in, and then clear the box for the next scan.

3. Phone scanning (TODO)

4. The Check-in status page (described in detail below) allows assistants and administrators to manually check-in particular people or entire institutions without needing to know their identifiers. This style of check-in is designed for use an auditorium type situation where you might be calling out to identify missing people or identifying absences on a per-institution basis.

Viewing Check-Ins
=================

On the *Statuses* section of Check-ins you can view who has or has not been checked-in.
