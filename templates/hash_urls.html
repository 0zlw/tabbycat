    The hashed URLs for public ballot and/or feedback submission are given below.
  {% else %}
    Hashed URLs are used for public ballot and/or feedback submission. You
    should use them if you have a means of distributing crazy-looking URLs to
    participants, and are too worried about fraud to use a publicly accessible
    page where <em>anyone</em> can enter <em>any</em> submission. The URLs
    will look something like this: <b>{% tournament_absurl public_enter_feedback_team_hash "9dnFlP3Z" %}</b>.
  {% endif %}
</p>
<p>
  Anyone with the URLs can access the relevant data entry page. The idea is that
  it's hard to guess another hash (the random-looking string), so you should
  make each URL accessible only to the team or adjudicator in question,
  <i>e.g.</i> by e-mailing it to them. It's not a perfect security solution.
  It's meant to discourage fraud, not prevent it.
</p>

<p>
  If you're not fussed at all about security or data entry fraud, it's easier
  for everyone if you just enable the normal public ballots and feedback pages
  instead, on the <a href="{% tournament_url tournament_config %}">tournament
  configuration page</a>.

  If you want to delete these, run this command in a shell on your server:
  <code>python manage.py url_hashes delete {{ tournament_slug }}</code>.

    <b>public ballots hash</b> on the <a href="{% tournament_url tournament_config %}">
    tournament configuration page</a> for this to work. (You don't need to
    enable both, just whichever ones you want to work.)
