## Licensing and Development

We haven't released this under an open-source licence (so there is no formal general right to use this software), but if you're running a debating tournament, you're welcome to use it. It'd be nice if you could please let us know that you're doing so, and let us know how it went. [Our Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/tabbycat.debate/) is a great place to start. We're happy to help if you have any questions (contact below) or feature requests (see [above](#something-missing)), though obviously we provide no warranty and disclaim all legal liability. Pull requests are encouraged.
