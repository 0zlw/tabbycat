Tabbycat is a draw tabulation system for 3 vs 3 debating tournaments. It was used at Auckland Australs 2010, [Victoria Australs 2012](https://www.facebook.com/Australs2012), [Otago Australs 2014](http://australs2014.herokuapp.com), [Daejeon Australs 2015](http://australs2015.herokuapp.com) and [many other tournaments of all sizes](http://tabbycat.readthedocs.io/en/stable/about/tournament-history.html).

Our **demo site** is at [tabbycatdebate.herokuapp.com](http://tabbycatdebate.herokuapp.com/). It's normally up, but its form will vary from time to time as we set up new feature demos for people. If it's down and you'd like to see it, or if you want to play with it as if you were running a tournament, [contact us](#authors-and-contacts). To see a post-tournament website, have a look at the [Daejeon Australs 2015 tab website](http://australs2015.herokuapp.com).

Tabbycat started as Australs tab software and has since evolved to support most two-team parliamentary formats. It is a goal of Tabbycat to be flexible, to meet the needes of different tournaments. There are many configurable features, and they're best explored by launching your own copy using the "Deploy to Heroku" button above.

If your tournament has requirements that we don't currently support, please [get in touch with us](#authors-and-contacts). In many cases, we might have already put the idea on our [to-do list](https://github.com/czlee/tabbycat/issues). But we have many more ideas than we are able to implement. We prioritise our work by the features that will be used at upcoming tournaments, so if you need some changes, even if they're already on our list, please do contact us early rather than waiting for us to implement your requirement.

## Installation and User Guide

Our user guide is at http://tabbycat.readthedocs.io/.

If you'd like to run a tournament with Tabbycat but are not able to set it up, get in touch with [Philip](http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/d?k=01aItEbHtwnn1PzIPGGM9W8A==&c=XWljk2iGokfhziV2Rt4OiKA5uab1vCrnxwXcPUsWgnM=) and he can setup a private online copy of the software for your use.

## License and Development

We haven't released this under an open-source licence (so there is no formal general right to use this software), but if you're running a debating tournament, you're welcome to use it. It'd be nice if you could please let us know that you're doing so, and let us know how it went. [Our Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/tabbycat.debate/) is a great place to start. We're happy to help if you have any questions or feature requests although we provide no warranty and disclaim all legal liability.

Pull requests are encouraged and if you're interested in helping out as a developer, we'd love to have you! [Join our Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/tabbycat.debate/) and contact us as below.

If you have a GitHub account, we'd prefer that **bug reports** be submitted to our [issues page](https://github.com/czlee/tabbycat/issues). Otherwise, feel free to [shoot us an email](#authors-and-contacts).
