# Tabbycat

Tabbycat is a draw tabulation system for 3 vs 3 debating tournaments.

Tabbycat was authored by Qi-Shan Lim for Auckland Australs 2010, was also used at [Victoria Australs 2012](http://australs2012.com), and will be used at [Otago Australs 2014](http://australs2014.com).

We haven't released this under an open-source licence (so there is no formal general right to use this software), but if you're running a debating tournament, you're welcome to use it. It'd be nice if you could please let us know that you're doing so, and let us know how it went. We're happy to help if you have any
questions (contact below), though obviously we provide no warranty and disclaim all legal liability. Pull requests are encouraged.

If you're interested in using, developing or otherwise following this software,
