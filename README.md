# Tabbycat

Tabbycat is a draw tabulation system for 3 vs 3 debating tournaments. It was used at Auckland Australs 2010, [Victoria Australs 2012](http://australs2012.com) and [Otago Australs 2014](http://tab.australs2014.com).

If you're interested in using, developing or otherwise following this software,

- Configurable [draw generation rules](https://github.com/czlee/tabbycat/wiki/Draw-generation)

#### Something missing?

The system's currently optimized for Australs, but we're developing for all two-team formats. So if your tournament has different requirements to what we have (say, different draw rules or number of speakers), odds are we've already thought about it and it's on the [to-do list](https://github.com/czlee/tabbycat/issues).

That said, our to-do list is long. **We prioritise our work by the features that will be used first.** So if you're planning to use it for a tournament but need some changes, please don't be shyâ€”get in touch with us (below) and we'll be more than happy to help. Please don't just wait for us to implement your requirement: we'd rather have the real-time feedback about which features are most useful!
 
## Installation and User Guide
All installation instructions and user guidelines are on the [wiki for this repository](https://github.com/czlee/tabbycat/wiki/).

#### Assisted Setup

If you want to run a tournament with Tabby Cat but are not able to set it up, get in touch with [Philip](http://www.google.com/recaptcha/mailhide/d?k=01aItEbHtwnn1PzIPGGM9W8A==&c=XWljk2iGokfhziV2Rt4OiKA5uab1vCrnxwXcPUsWgnM=) and he can setup a private and online copy of the software for your use.

## Licensing and Development

We haven't released this under an open-source licence (so there is no formal general right to use this software), but if you're running a debating tournament, you're welcome to use it. It'd be nice if you could please let us know that you're doing so, and let us know how it went. [Our Facebook group](https://www.facebook.com/groups/tabbycat.debate/) is a great place to start. We're happy to help if you have any questions (contact below) or feature requests (see [above](#something-missing)), though obviously we provide no warranty and disclaim all legal liability. Pull requests are encouraged.
