   already have them:

   $ sudo apt-get install libpq-dev python-dev python-virtualenv

   If you're expecting the PostgreSQL database to be on your computer,
   don't forget you'll need the server as well as the client:

   $ sudo apt-get install postgresql

1) Create virtualenv named 'env' in root directory:

   $ virtualenv env

   from the shell):
